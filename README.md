##  Recommendations
Zayd Majid

John Dominick Limpag is my role model in cybersecurity. He began his career as a bug bounty hunter and subsequently secured a position as a Security Operations Center Engineer at Adventus. He is a co-founder of a school organization at Ateneo de Zamboanga University named the Information Security Students Organization, which aims to spread awareness and teach students about cybersecurity. I highly recommend him because he has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, he is a diligent worker, and he possesses excellent cooperation skills.

##  Achievements and Awards
